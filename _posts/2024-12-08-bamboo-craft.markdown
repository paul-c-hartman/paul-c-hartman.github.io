welcome! this might seem complicated but i promise--it shouldn't take more than 5 or 10 minutes, max.

# step-by-step
this server is being exposed to the internet through a cloudflare tunnel, and because of reasons, this means you need to use a mod to let you connect to the server through the tunnel. as of writing this, the only option that works on the correct minecraft version is [modflared](https://modrinth.com/mod/modflared) ([also on curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modflared)).

if mods aren't particularly your thing, here is a short, three-item list of instructions to get you playing asap:

## downloading a launcher
you've already downloaded mojang's launcher to play the game in the first place, but it doesn't play nice with mods. i personally use and recommend [modrinth launcher](https://modrinth.com/app); i've had zero problems with it and it's easy to use. no account or anything of that sort is required.

you can download the launcher from the link above and install it, or use a different launcher if you prefer.

## installing modflared
for this, you can build your own modpack, but i have also provided two versions you can just import and use: [barebones](/assets/dl/bamboo-craft/barebones.mrpack) (no gameplay difference from vanilla) and [lightly-modded](/assets/dl/bamboo-craft/lightly-modded.mrpack) (has some quality-of-life mods). i recommend you use one of these as building your own may pull you down a rabbit hole/take a lot of time.

to import one of these modpacks:
- download the pack, it should be a file ending in `.mrpack`.
- open modrinth launcher.
- click the 'create profile' button in the bottom left (it's the green square with a plus on it): <br /><br />
  ![modrinth "create profile" button](/assets/images/bamboo-craft/modrinth-create-profile.png) <br /><br />
- select the "from file" option: <br /><br />
  ![modrinth "create instance" dialog, "from file" tab](/assets/images/bamboo-craft/modrinth-from-file-dialog.png) <br /><br />
- drag the file onto the dialog box or press "import from file" and navigate to it.
- you should now see the pack on the home page (and the library page); click on it to find the play button: <br /><br />
  ![modrinth profile, showing "play" button](/assets/images/bamboo-craft/modrinth-profile-play-button.png) <br /><br />

to build your own, you'll need to make sure that your pack includes [modflared](https://modrinth.com/mod/modflared) (also linked above) and [fabric api](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) to be able to connect.

## playing the game
once you've got your game running, head over to the multiplayer menu and put in `mc.celibatebamboo.uk`. don't laugh too much about the domain--it was cheap. when you connect, you may see a message flash on the screen about "opening a cloudflare tunnel" or something similar--if you don't see that and it times out, chances are you don't have the mod installed correctly.

# problems?
if you have any problems, first wait a couple minutes and try again; i'm not the best at server maintenance so i may have just accidentally turned off the server or some other nincompoopery.

if that doesn't work then please contact me. you should have my number if nothing else and my email is listed at the bottom of this page. i do check that address a few times a month so i might even see it if you email me.
