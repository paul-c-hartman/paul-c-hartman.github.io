welcome! this might seem complicated but i promise--it shouldn't take more than 5 or 10 minutes, max.

# step-by-step
this server is being exposed to the internet through a cloudflare tunnel, and because of reasons, this means you need to use a mod to let you connect to the server through the tunnel. as of writing this, the only option that works on the correct minecraft version is [modflared](https://modrinth.com/mod/modflared) ([also on curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modflared)).

if mods aren't particularly your thing, here is a short, three-item list of instructions to get you playing asap:

## downloading a launcher
you've already downloaded mojang's launcher to play the game in the first place, but it doesn't play nice with mods. i personally use and recommend [modrinth launcher](https://modrinth.com/app); i've had zero problems with it and it's easy to use. no account or anything of that sort is required.

you can download the launcher from the link above and install it, or use a different launcher if you prefer.

## installing modflared
to connect, you'll need to make sure that your pack includes these mods:
- [modflared](https://modrinth.com/mod/modflared) (also linked above)
- [fabric api](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)

to be able to connect. The server is currently running Minecraft version ~~1.21.3~~ ~~1.21.4~~ 1.21.10.

## playing the game
once you've got your game running, head over to the multiplayer menu and put in `mc.celibatebamboo.uk`. don't laugh too much about the domain--it was cheap. when you connect, you may see a message flash on the screen about "opening a cloudflare tunnel" or something similar--if you don't see that and it times out, chances are you don't have the mod installed correctly.
