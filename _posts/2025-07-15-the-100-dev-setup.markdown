# the 100-dev jam
hello lovely people! and welcome to the [100-dev jam](https://github.com/Griiimon/100-devs-misc). (here is the [discord](https://discord.gg/mmCFxrrvNz) as well.) this is the definitive guide for how to get set up to participate if you aren't sure what to do. let's get going!

## godot
firstly, you'll need to download and install [godot](https://godotengine.org/) if you haven't already.

## git
secondly, you'll need to integrate it with git.

to get started with the project, you'll need to [install git on your system](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). make sure to also [set your username](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/setting-your-username-in-git) and [set your email](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git). **make sure the email you use is one that's registered to your github account.**

## download and sync
after that, select a folder where you'd like your copy of the project to live, and open a terminal in that folder. here's what that looks like on my linux machine:

![opening a terminal from folder's context menu on linux](/assets/images/the-100-dev-setup/open-terminal-from-context-menu-linux.png)

here's what it looks like on windows:

![opening a terminal from folder's context menu on windows](/assets/images/the-100-dev-setup/open-terminal-from-context-menu-windows.png)

once you've opened the terminal in that folder, enter one of these commands to download the project (note the trailing period):

- test run: `git clone https://github.com/100-Devs-1-Game/Pong-Test-Run.git .`

- ~~full project:~~ the full project doesn't have a repository yet.

you should get output that looks something like this:

```
Cloning into '.'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 18, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (18/18), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (17/17), done.
remote: Total 18 (delta 4), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (18/18), 7.24 KiB | 7.24 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (4/4), done.
```

# godot again
now you're ready to open godot! once you have it open, select "import existing project", and select the folder you chose earlier.

**before you do anything in godot,** make sure you read the contribution guide in the project folder. there are important steps to take before you start making changes. (if you're setting up for the test run, you may not see it yet--it hasn't been uploaded at the time of writing.)

# happy coding!
