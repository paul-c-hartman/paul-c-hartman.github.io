hello lovely people! and welcome to the [100-dev jam](https://github.com/Griiimon/100-devs-misc). (here is the [discord](https://discord.gg/mmCFxrrvNz) as well.) this is the definitive guide for how to get set up to participate if you aren't sure what to do. let's get going!

## godot
firstly, you'll need to download and install [godot](https://godotengine.org/) if you haven't already.

## git
secondly, you'll need to integrate it with git. if you haven't used git before, we recommend installing and using [github desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop).

once you have that set up, go to *file > clone repository* as shown.

![file > clone repository](/assets/images/the-100-dev-setup/ghd-clone-repo.png)

in the *url or username/repository* field, enter `100-Devs-1-Game/Pong-Test-Run` for the test run or `Griiimon/100-devs-misc` for the full project, then press *clone*.

after that, select *repository > pull* to download the project files.

![repository > pull](/assets/images/the-100-dev-setup/ghd-pull-repo.png)

finally, select *repository > show in your file manager* and make a note of where the folder is.

# godot again
now you're ready to open godot! once you have it open, select *import existing project*, and select the folder you took a note of in the last step.

**before you do anything in godot,** make sure you read the contribution guide in the project folder. there are important steps to take before you start making changes. (if you're setting up for the test run, you may not see it yet--it hasn't been uploaded at the time of writing.)

# happy coding!
