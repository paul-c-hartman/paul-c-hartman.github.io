I've always wanted to start a blog, but I've never had the nerve to actually do it. It's intimidating. I mean, just being honest, it took me probably 3 hours to get to this point and here's my todo list still:

1. Fix text in "About" page
2. Add proper license in footer
3. Figure out how to get some theme other than the default theme working
4. Spend time customizing that theme
5. Research and write content
6. Add social media links, terms for SEO, etc.

So you can understand how this might be a bit of a time-sink. But hey, there's only one first time. The second time is always faster.
